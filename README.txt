This is code to calculate the Ramsey number of S-diffsequences.
That is, for any set S, and integers k and r, it calculates the least n such that all r-colorings of [1, n] must contain at least one monochromatic k-term S-diffsequence, where an S-diffsequences is a sequences where successive values are seperated by elements of S.
Transprimes.cpp specifically calculates this for the set P+c, where c is any integer. This is the set of all integers exactly equal to a prime number+c.
This code has input and output purely through the cin and cout libraries.
